<h1>Creaturetopia (PHP)</h1>
<h3>Earliaer work</h3>
<p>This is a continuation of my <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/Creaturetopia">Creatutopia</a> respository. It will include php, so will be code only.</p>
<p>To see a demo of my site, see my Creatutopia repository.</p>
<h3> Continuation of The RET Course</h3>
<p>I removed the old links on the <a href="./animal-reference.html">species list</a> and <a href="./petinfo.html">Animal Info</a> pages.</p> 
<p>I have started an <a href="./faq.html">FAQ page</a> and connected it to the CSS file for the site. I will add the questions and answers soon, looking at other sites for possible questions, and also add othrs people ask me when I talk about my project that are appropriate i.e. Focusing on the game and game play itself, not code, etc.</p>
<h3>After the RET course</h3>
<p>I now have <a href="https://github.com/2pisoftware/cmfive-core">2Pi Software's Cmfive code</a> on my computer, and am learning to use it so that I may add a database to my site. You can see this code is <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/creaturetopiaCmfive">this repository</a>. All information and updates about the Cmfive and database code will be included in <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/Creatretopia-2/blob/master/README.md">this README file</a> (Craeturetopia (PHP)).</p>
<p>I am still working through the CSS part of <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp</a>'s Certificate in Responsive Web Design, and adding parts of it to my site.</p>
