<h1>Creaturetopia (PHP)</h1>
<h3>Earliaer work</h3>
<p>This is a continuation of my <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/Creaturetopia">Creatutopia</a> respository. It will include php, so will be code only.</p>
<p>To see a demo of my site, see my Creatutopia repository (above link).</p>
<h3> Continuation of The RET Course</h3>
<p>I removed the old links on the <a href="./animal-reference.html">species list</a> and <a href="./petinfo.html">Animal Info</a> pages.</p> 
<p>I have started an <a href="./faq.html">FAQ page</a> and connected it to the CSS file for the site. I will add the questions and answers soon, looking at other sites for possible questions, and also add othrs people ask me when I talk about my project that are appropriate i.e. Focusing on the game and game play itself, not code, etc.</p>
<h3>After the RET course</h3>
<p>I now have <a href="https://github.com/2pisoftware/cmfive-core">2Pi Software's Cmfive code</a> on my computer, and am learning to use it so that I may add a database to my site. You can see this code is <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/creaturetopiaCmfive">this repository</a>. All information and updates about the Cmfive and database code will be included in <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/Creatretopia-2/blob/master/README.md">this README file</a> (Craeturetopia (PHP)).</p>
<p>I am still working through the CSS part of <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp</a>'s Certificate in Responsive Web Design, and adding parts of it to my site.</p>
<p>My initial sample version of this game (which may be included in this or a seperate respository, work to commence soon) will use a simple 'blob' creature called My Blob. There will be no database and saving. Initially, with a number of set items to use on the 'creature', you will be able to increase its stats. The hygine will also automatically decrease over time. one update will allow you to enter it in shows against three NPCs (non player characters), Blobby, Blobina, and The Blob, which will get tandomly generated stats each time you hit 'Enter Show'. You will then see a  pop-up or new window with a back button with the results. A final update will allow medals to appear on your pets page for each show where it placed (1st, 2nd, and 3rd. I may also add a renaming feature. After this, work will be focused soley on the official game.</p>
<p>I am working on adding tables to my database for my <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/creaturetopiaCmfive">creaturetopia module</a>. I have created one for <a href="./petinfo.html">petinfo.html</a> using the filler text as column names. I have started to add information to this table for my first animal. This will need to be edited. However, an 'edit animal' feature has alredy been added to the table.</p>
<p>I have started a simplefied version of the game in my Creatutretopia Sample repository. It now has a basic index page explaing the game in it' smost basic form.</p>
<p>For the Creaturetopia Sample of the game, I can probably use a canvas to display the 'animal's' stats. As the canvas can react to a user's click actions, and JavaScript, I can set it up so that the numbers of particular stats increase within a designated range depending on the use button clicked i.e. the item 'use' button the user clicks on. In JavaScript I may also be able to cause the 'hygine' stat to go down automatically over time, whilst the game is loaded.</p>
<p>As I am planning to have the item and animal pages seperate for the actual game (as there will be multipe animals, only select items can be used on some animals, and not all users will have all items), I will have to find a different way to cause effects on the stats therough item use, but the canvas will help me to practice woking out how items might affect the animals, and increase their stats.<p>
