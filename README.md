<h1>Creaturetopia (PHP)</h1>
<h3>Earliaer work</h3>
<p>This is a continuation of my <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/Creaturetopia">Creatutopia</a> respository. It will include php, so will be code only.</p>
<p>To see a demo of my site, see my Creatutopia repository (above link).</p>
<h3> Continuation of The RET Course</h3>
<p>I removed the old links on the <a href="./animal-reference.html">species list</a> and <a href="./petinfo.html">Animal Info</a> pages.</p> 
<p>I have started an <a href="./faq.html">FAQ page</a> and connected it to the CSS file for the site. I will add the questions and answers soon, looking at other sites for possible questions, and also add othrs people ask me when I talk about my project that are appropriate i.e. Focusing on the game and game play itself, not code, etc.</p>
<h3>After the RET course</h3>
<p>I now have <a href="https://github.com/2pisoftware/cmfive-core">2Pi Software's Cmfive code</a> on my computer, and am learning to use it so that I may add a database to my site. You can see this code is <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/creaturetopiaCmfive">this repository</a>. All information and updates about the Cmfive and database code will be included in <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/Creatretopia-2/blob/master/README.md">this README file</a> (Craeturetopia (PHP)).</p>
<p>I am still working through the CSS part of <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp</a>'s Certificate in Responsive Web Design, and adding parts of it to my site.</p>
<p>My initial sample version of this game (which may be included in this or a seperate respository, work to commence soon) will use a simple 'blob' creature called My Blob. There will be no database and saving. Initially, with a number of set items to use on the 'creature', you will be able to increase its stats. The hygine will also automatically decrease over time. one update will allow you to enter it in shows against three NPCs (non player characters), Blobby, Blobina, and The Blob, which will get tandomly generated stats each time you hit 'Enter Show'. You will then see a  pop-up or new window with a back button with the results. A final update will allow medals to appear on your pets page for each show where it placed (1st, 2nd, and 3rd. I may also add a renaming feature. After this, work will be focused soley on the official game.</p>
<p>I am working on adding tables to my database for my <a href="https://github.com/Tinystep1/creaturetopiaCmfive">creaturetopia module</a>. I have created one for <a href="./petinfo.html">petinfo.html</a> using the filler text as column names. I have started to add information to this table for my first animal. This will need to be edited. However, an 'edit animal' feature has alredy been added to the table.</p>
